# Production_demand_Prediction

A Senario where a product company plans to offer discounts on its product during the upcoming holiday season, the company wants to find the price at which its product can be a better deal compared to its competitors. For this task, the company provided a dataset of past changes in sales based on price changes. We need to train a model that can predict the demand for the product in the market with different price segments.

The data set is as follows :
1. the product_id;
2. store_id;
3. total price at which product was sold;
4. base price at which product was sold;
5. Units sold (quantity demanded);

Here, we will train a simple machine model for the task of product demand prediction using Python. Price is one of the major factors that affect the demand for the product.
